Lately I've been tinkering with home automation, and I wanted to see if I could do something smart
with an [Amazon Dash Button](https://www.amazon.com/Dash-Buttons/b?ie=UTF8&node=10667898011).
They do have official IoT versions but the Dash ones are easy to hack into
something more useful and are sometimes on sale for $0.99, so it's definitely worth trying out.

I have a vinyl record player hooked up to my Sonos via line-in, and every now and then when I head over
to put on a new record I find that I was playing something else before. So now I have to go get my phone,
open the Sonos app and choose the line-in input.
That's not good, I want to be lazy! So enter a the Dash button, a simple device that can help us get rid of pesky apps.

For this to work there are a few pieces of software needed. I run this on a Raspberry Pi, but you can
run it on anything essentially. The first software you need is [Dasher](https://github.com/maddox/dasher) and it's very useful scripts.

```
git clone https://github.com/maddox/dasher
cd dasher/scripts
```

Run the `find_button` script to get your Amazon Dash Button's MAC address, we'll need that to identify what Dash button is
being pressed (we can have many Dash buttons that do a lot of different things).
After starting the script, press your Dash button and you should see something like this:

```
./script/find_button

Watching for arp & udp requests on your local network, please try to press your dash now
Dash buttons should appear as manufactured by 'Amazon Technologies Inc.'
Possible dash hardware address detected: ac:63:be:d6:8a:33 Manufacturer: Amazon Technologies Inc. Protocol: udp
Possible dash hardware address detected: ac:63:be:d6:8a:33 Manufacturer: Amazon Technologies Inc. Protocol: arp
```

Great! Now we have the MAC address. Let's continue on with configuring Dasher and run it.

Create your own [requestb.in](http://requestb.in) and then substitute your own URL and MAC in a sample `config/config.json` like this:

```
{"buttons":[
  {
    "name": "Test Dash Button",
    "address": "ac:63:be:d6:8a:33",
    "url": "http://requestb.in/10oaa5x1",
    "method": "POST",
    "json": true,
    "body": {"is_this_working": "yes"}
  }
]}
```

Now run Dasher and test your button:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~/dasher $ sudo npm run start

> dasher@1.1.1 start /home/pi/dasher
> node app.js

[2017-01-05T20:48:27.134Z] Test Dash Button added.
[2017-01-05T20:48:36.050Z] Test Dash Button pressed.
```

Yay! Success! If everything worked correctly you should also have seen a new POST coming into the [requestb.in](http://requestb.in) address.
Now we can get started on the Sonos integration. For that you'll need the [sonos-node-http-api](https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api).

After installing and running that it will auto-discover your Sonos units, making it easy to send commands to them.
Test it by having your Sonos UI open and doing the following:

```
pi@raspberrypi:~ $ curl http://localhost:5005/yourroomname/linein
{"status":"success"}
```

Your Sonos player should now have changed over to line-in instead of whatever was playing before. Awesome!

So now all you need to do is connect these two services. You can use this example config file for Dasher:

```
{"buttons":[
  {
    "name": "Play some Sonos Vinyl",
    "address": "ac:63:be:d6:8a:33",
    "url": "http://localhost:5005/yourroomname/linein",
    "method": "GET"
  }
]}
```

That's it, nothing more to it. You now have control over Sonos using a little awesome button from Amazon for less that the price of a coffee.
Enjoy!

## Extra points

To run Dasher and the Sonos API as services you could use many of the available Docker images.
I'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
